Hotel Project is a web application that provides services of choosing and booking a room, paying invoices, etc.
The client registers in the system and submits an application for staying at the hotel.
The client can also select a room from the list of available rooms using sorting and filtering functionality and book it.
The manager reviews the received applications, selects the most suitable of the available rooms and sends a request to the client to confirm the booking.
The request is displayed in the user's personal account. After the room is booked, the system issues an invoice to the client.
If the invoice is not paid by the due date, the booking is automatically withdrawn.
